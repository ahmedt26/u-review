# UReview
### Created Friday, October 1st, 2021
### Abdullah Nafees and Tahseen Ahmed

UReview is a duo project for CS 4WW3, a website used to review things.

## A1
### A1 Notes
We have excess images in some spots and the ratios aren't the same as the original,
which causes Lighthouse to flag them as issues.
They'll be fixed once we continue developing the site (proper backend/dynamic system.)

### Resources Used
Bootstrap 5
https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.1/getting-started/introduction/

We used  the Navbar and Card examples as of now.

## A2
### A2 Notes
The repo is at 
https://github.com/ahmedt26/ureview
The site is hosted by ahmedt26 (Tahseen) on https://ahmedt26.github.io/ureview/

Essentially every page was changed, and the javascript components are in the index.js file.

The images we used are from Google Maps, usually the first image of the example location (they are real locations).
